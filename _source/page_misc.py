      <h2>Who we are</h2>
      <p>Rapid Response Restoration is owned and run by <strong>AJ Alqraini</strong>, working out of a facility at {STREET} in the Dallas Design District. We handle emergency restoration &mdash; water, fire, smoke, mold, storm and biohazard &mdash; along with the junk removal, storage and reconstruction work that a property needs afterward.</p>
      <p>The reason those things sit under one roof is not marketing. It is because the seam between them is where restoration jobs usually go wrong.</p>

      <h2>The problem we built the company around</h2>
      <p>Here is what typically happens after a water loss. A mitigation company dries the property and leaves. You are handed a list of contractors. The contractor you hire did not see what was behind the wall, is working from a scope someone else wrote, and disagrees with parts of it. Your adjuster now has two companies describing the same job differently. Meanwhile you are living in a house with open walls, waiting on a bid.</p>
      <p>We carry the whole job. Tear-out gets scoped with the rebuild in mind, one scope goes to your carrier, and there is one person to call when something is not right.</p>

      <h2>How we work</h2>
      <p>Restoration is a measurement trade wearing a construction trade's clothes. Whether a material can be saved is a question with a numerical answer, and we treat it that way &mdash; thermal imaging and moisture meters on arrival, a documented dry standard, readings logged every day, and equipment sized to a calculated load rather than to what happens to be on the truck.</p>
      <p>That matters to you in two directions. It stops materials being demolished that could have been dried, and it stops walls being closed over structures that are not actually dry. It also produces the documentation package your insurance claim needs, which is the difference between a settlement based on evidence and one based on an argument.</p>

      <h2>What we will tell you honestly</h2>
      <p>We will tell you when something can be dried in place instead of replaced, even though replacement invoices for more. We will tell you when we find mold rather than quietly expanding the scope. We will tell you whether you can stay in the house before you have made other plans, not at 9pm on the first night. And if a job is outside what we do well, we will say so and point you to someone who does it better.</p>

      <h2>Service area</h2>
      <p>We cover 29 cities across Dallas, Tarrant, Collin and Denton counties &mdash; from Fort Worth to Celina and everywhere between. Being physically inside the Metroplex is not a detail in this trade. It is the difference between equipment running in your house tonight and equipment running tomorrow.</p>

      <h2>Who we work with</h2>
      <p><strong>Homeowners</strong> make up most of what we do. Usually the call comes at a bad moment, from someone who has never had a loss before and does not know what happens next. A large part of the job is explaining that clearly.</p>
      <p><strong>Landlords and property managers</strong> need documentation and speed, because a unit out of service is revenue lost and a tenant without a working bathroom is a problem that escalates. We work from unit lists and provide per-unit photographic records.</p>
      <p><strong>Business owners</strong> are usually weighing the cost of the work against the cost of being closed. We phase around trading hours where we can and work overnight where that gets the doors open sooner.</p>
      <p><strong>HOAs and multi-family communities</strong> bring the added complexity of shared structure, where one failure crosses several units and several policies. We scope by unit so each carrier receives documentation for what their policy actually covers.</p>
      <p><strong>Realtors and estate representatives</strong> generally have a deadline &mdash; a listing date, a closing, a probate timeline &mdash; and need the property presentable by a specific day rather than eventually.</p>

      <h2>How to check out any restoration company</h2>
      <p>Including this one. After a storm especially, a lot of people knock on doors in DFW who will not be here next year.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask for a physical local address, and look it up</li>
        <li>Ask for current proof of general liability insurance, and check the dates</li>
        <li>Ask who is actually doing the work &mdash; employees, or subcontractors nobody has met</li>
        <li>Ask for the scope in writing before anything begins</li>
        <li>Walk away from anyone offering to waive or absorb your deductible &mdash; that is illegal in Texas and it makes you part of it</li>
        <li>Read anything described as an assignment of benefits very carefully before signing; it can transfer control of your claim</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Any company that is going to be around to honour a workmanship warranty can answer all of that in about a minute.</p>

      <p>If your city is not on our list, call anyway. The list reflects where we work regularly, not a boundary we refuse to cross, and we would rather tell you honestly whether we are the right people for your address than have you keep searching.</p>

      <h2>If you are calling on behalf of someone else</h2>
      <p>This happens often &mdash; an adult child calling about a parent's house, a property manager about a tenant, an executor about an estate. You do not need to be the policyholder to call us and ask questions, and you do not need to be at the property while we work.</p>
      <p>What we will need before work begins is authorisation from someone with authority over the property. We will tell you exactly what that means for your situation rather than leaving you to guess.</p>

      <h2>Language and accessibility</h2>
      <p>If it is easier for you to write than to speak, email works and we will reply in writing. If this website is difficult for you to use in any way, call and we will simply do the thing you were trying to do &mdash; and then fix the site.</p>

      <h2>What we provide your carrier</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Dated photographic documentation of every affected area, taken before work begins</li>
        <li>Moisture maps showing the measured extent of water migration, including inside wall cavities</li>
        <li>Daily drying logs with material readings, temperature, humidity and equipment counts</li>
        <li>Line-item scopes in the estimating format carriers work from</li>
        <li>Itemized contents inventories with condition and disposition</li>
        <li>A complete closing package for your records at completion</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What is usually covered &mdash; and what usually is not</h2>
      <p><strong>Typically covered:</strong> sudden and accidental water damage such as a burst pipe, failed water heater or appliance line; fire and smoke damage; damage from wind and hail; and in many cases mold that results directly from a covered event that was reported and remediated promptly.</p>
      <p><strong>Typically not covered:</strong> flooding from outside the property, which requires separate flood insurance; gradual leaks and seepage; damage attributed to deferred maintenance; and in most base policies, sewer and drain backup unless you carry that endorsement. Many Texas policies also cap mold coverage at a fixed amount regardless of actual cost.</p>
      <p>Every policy is different, and this is general information rather than advice about your specific coverage &mdash; your policy documents and your carrier are the authority on what you have.</p>

      <h2>A warning about post-storm door knockers</h2>
      <p>After every significant DFW hail event, out-of-state crews work neighborhoods within days. Some are legitimate. Be very cautious with anyone who arrives uninvited, pressures you to sign immediately, offers to waive or absorb your deductible, or asks you to sign an assignment of benefits before you have read it. <strong>Absorbing a deductible is illegal in Texas</strong> and it makes you a party to it. Ask any contractor &mdash; including us &mdash; for a physical local address and current proof of insurance before you sign.</p>

      <h2>Mistakes that cost people money</h2>
      <h3>Throwing damaged items away before photographing them</h3>
      <p>The single most expensive habit we see. An item photographed, described and listed is an item your policy can reimburse. An item already in a dumpster is one you will be asked to prove existed, months later, from memory.</p>
      <h3>Waiting to report</h3>
      <p>Late reporting is one of the most common reasons claims get reduced. You do not need a full assessment before you open the claim &mdash; report it as soon as the property is safe, then let the detail follow.</p>
      <h3>Doing nothing because you are waiting on the adjuster</h3>
      <p>Your policy requires you to prevent further damage. Waiting a week for an inspection while water sits is not neutral; it grows the loss and gives the carrier a reason to question the additional damage.</p>
      <h3>Signing on the doorstep</h3>
      <p>Nothing about a legitimate restoration job requires a signature within five minutes of meeting someone. Pressure to sign immediately is itself the warning.</p>
      <h3>Accepting a first number without a written scope</h3>
      <p>A settlement figure with no itemised scope behind it cannot be checked. Ask for the line-item scope, and compare it against what a contractor says the work actually involves.</p>
      <h3>Not asking about code upgrades</h3>
      <p>On older properties, code-driven costs are real and often covered by ordinance or law coverage. Nobody will volunteer this. Ask.</p>

<h2>Who we are</h2>
<p>{NAME}, {STREET}, {CITY}, {REGION} {ZIP}. Phone {PHONE}. Email <a href="mailto:{EMAIL}">{EMAIL}</a>. This policy explains what we collect through this website and how we use it.</p>
<h2>Information we collect</h2>
<p><strong>Information you give us.</strong> When you submit a form or call us, we collect your name, phone number, email address, property address and the details you provide about your situation. We use this solely to respond to you and to provide the services you ask for.</p>
<p><strong>Information collected automatically.</strong> Like most websites, ours may record standard technical information such as IP address, browser type, device type, pages visited and referring site. This is used to understand how the site is used and to keep it working properly.</p>
<h2>How we use your information</h2>
<ul><li>To respond to enquiries and dispatch crews</li><li>To prepare estimates and provide services</li><li>To communicate with your insurance carrier when you ask us to</li><li>To keep records required for business and legal purposes</li><li>To improve the website</li></ul>
<h2>Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell your personal information. We share it only with people who need it to deliver your job &mdash; our technicians and subcontractors, your insurance carrier or adjuster where you have asked us to, and service providers who help us operate (for example hosting or email). We may disclose information where required by law.</p>
<h2>Cookies and analytics</h2>
<p>This site may use cookies and third-party analytics to understand traffic and improve performance. You can control cookies through your browser settings; disabling them may affect some functionality.</p>
<h2>Third-party content</h2>

<h2>Text messages</h2>
<p>If you provide a mobile number, we may contact you by text about your job or enquiry. Message and data rates may apply. Reply STOP at any time to opt out.</p>
<h2>Security and retention</h2>
<p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information we hold, and keep it only as long as needed for the purposes above or as required by law. No method of transmission over the internet is completely secure.</p>
<h2>Your choices</h2>
<p>You may ask us what personal information we hold about you, ask us to correct it, or ask us to delete it where we are not required to keep it. Contact us at <a href="mailto:{EMAIL}">{EMAIL}</a> or {PHONE}.</p>

<h2>Agreement</h2>
<p>By using this website you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the site.</p>
<h2>About the information here</h2>
<p>Content on this site is general information about restoration services. It is not professional, legal, insurance or medical advice, and it does not describe the coverage in your specific insurance policy. Every property and every loss is different &mdash; nothing here substitutes for an on-site assessment of your situation.</p>
<h2>No contract until it is in writing</h2>
<p>Submitting a form or calling us does not create a contract for services. Work is performed under a separate written agreement signed by both parties, which governs scope, pricing, schedule and warranty.</p>
<h2>Estimates</h2>
<p>Estimates are based on conditions observable at the time of assessment. Restoration frequently uncovers additional damage once materials are opened, and scope and price may change accordingly. Any change will be documented and communicated before that work proceeds.</p>
<h2>Insurance</h2>
<p>We are a restoration contractor. We are not an insurance company, an insurance agent or a public adjuster, and we do not negotiate claims or guarantee any coverage outcome. Decisions about your claim are made by your carrier under your policy.</p>
<h2>Intellectual property</h2>
<p>The content, design, logo and branding on this site belong to {NAME} and may not be reproduced without permission.</p>
<h2>Third-party links</h2>
<p>This site may link to or embed third-party services. We are not responsible for their content or practices.</p>
<h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
<p>To the extent permitted by law, {NAME} is not liable for indirect or consequential damages arising from use of this website. This does not limit any rights you have under your written service agreement with us or under Texas consumer protection law.</p>
<h2>Governing law</h2>
