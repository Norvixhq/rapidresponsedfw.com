      <h2>How to work out which service you need</h2>
      <p>Most people arrive here knowing what happened but not what it is called, and the honest answer is that it usually does not matter &mdash; describe the situation on the phone and we will tell you which of these it is. But if you would rather work it out yourself, the rough logic is this.</p>
      <p><strong>If water is involved and it happened suddenly</strong>, start with water damage restoration; extraction, structural drying and burst pipe repair are stages within that rather than separate jobs. <strong>If the water came from outside or from a sewer</strong>, it is flood cleanup, which is a contamination job rather than a drying job.</p>
      <p><strong>If there has been a fire</strong>, fire damage restoration covers the structure and rebuild, with smoke damage cleanup and odour removal handling the parts of the property the flames never reached. <strong>If you can smell something musty or see growth</strong>, that is mold remediation &mdash; and it almost always means there is a moisture source that needs finding first.</p>
      <p><strong>If a storm opened the building up</strong>, emergency board-up stops it getting worse and storm damage restoration puts it back. <strong>If the emergency is over and you need the property cleared or rebuilt</strong>, that is junk removal, contents cleaning, storage and moving, or renovation.</p>
      <p>Every one of these is available across all 29 cities we serve, for both residential and commercial property, and every one of them starts with a free assessment.</p>
