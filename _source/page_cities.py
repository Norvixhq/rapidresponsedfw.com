    <article class="prose">
      <h2>Emergency restoration for {city} homes and businesses</h2>
      <p>{d['intro']} From our shop at {STREET} in Dallas, {city} is {d['drive']} &mdash; which means when you call at 2am, the delay is drive time rather than a call center forwarding your details to a crew somewhere else.</p>
      <p>We cover the whole city, including {hoods}, and the areas around {marks}. Common ZIP codes we work in: {d['zips']}.</p>

      <h2>What makes {city} properties different</h2>
      <p>{d['stock']}</p>
      <p><strong>What that means for you:</strong> {d['risk']} We take that into account before we arrive, which is part of why local dispatch matters more in this trade than in most.</p>

      <h2>What to do right now</h2>
      <p>If something is actively happening in your {city} property, the first twenty minutes matter more than anything that comes afterward. Mold can begin growing on damp materials within 24 to 48 hours, and smoke residue starts etching glass and metal within hours.</p>

      <h3>Do these first</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Stop the water.</strong> At the fixture if you can reach it, otherwise at the main shutoff. If you do not know where your main is, now is the moment to find out &mdash; usually near the street, the water heater, or the garage wall.</li>
        <li><strong>Deal with the power carefully.</strong> If water is anywhere near outlets, the panel or a running appliance, stay out of that area entirely. Only kill the breaker if you can reach the panel without standing in water.</li>
        <li><strong>Photograph everything before you move anything.</strong> Wide shots of each room, then close-ups of the damage and the source. This is the single most valuable ten minutes of work you will do, and it cannot be recreated later.</li>
        <li><strong>Get valuables and documents somewhere dry.</strong> Papers, photographs and electronics, if it is safe to reach them.</li>
        <li><strong>Lift furniture off wet flooring.</strong> Foil or wood blocks under the legs stops finish bleeding into carpet and staining it permanently.</li>
        <li><strong>Call.</strong> Describe what happened and we will tell you what to do next, whether it is safe to stay, and roughly what you are looking at.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Do not do these</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Do not enter a fire-damaged structure</strong> until the fire department has cleared it, no matter how stable it looks.</li>
        <li><strong>Do not run a household shop vac</strong> on standing water. It has a fraction of the lift of an extractor, and on contaminated water it spreads the problem.</li>
        <li><strong>Do not turn on anything</strong> that has been wet or smoke-exposed &mdash; especially electronics. Applying power to a device with residue or moisture inside is what converts a cleanable item into a destroyed one.</li>
        <li><strong>Do not throw damaged items away</strong> before they are photographed and listed. An item already in a dumpster is one you will be asked to prove existed, months later, from memory.</li>
        <li><strong>Do not pull up wet carpet yourself.</strong> It tears at the seams and rarely goes back down without professional stretching, turning something salvageable into a replacement.</li>
        <li><strong>Do not run the HVAC</strong> if there has been smoke or if flood water reached the ducts. Every cycle redistributes contamination into rooms that were fine.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Signs worth calling about even when nothing looks wrong</h3>
      <p>Plenty of the damage we find in {city} was quietly underway for weeks. A musty smell that comes and goes with the weather, a water bill that jumped without explanation, a warm patch on a slab floor, paint that is bubbling or a baseboard that has begun to swell, a ceiling stain that has not visibly grown, or a door that has stopped closing squarely &mdash; each of those is worth a look. Assessment is free, and finding it early is the difference between a repair and a rebuild.</p>

      <p>We dispatch from our facility at {STREET} in the Dallas Design District, which puts us inside the Metroplex rather than driving into it. In this trade that matters more than it sounds: equipment has to arrive with the crew, and an hour of standing water is not a rounding error.</p>
      <p>The cities below span <strong>Dallas, Tarrant, Collin and Denton counties</strong>, and they are genuinely different from a restoration point of view. Richardson and east Plano are full of homes from an era whose cast iron drains and original water heaters are now at end of life. Irving and Carrollton carry large amounts of polybutylene supply line that fails without warning. Frisco, Prosper and Celina are almost entirely new build, where the failures are installation defects and attic HVAC rather than aging pipe. Fort Worth and downtown McKinney have historic stock with pier-and-beam floors and plaster walls that need drying rather than demolition. Las Colinas and Addison are vertical, where one failure travels through several floors and several tenants.</p>
