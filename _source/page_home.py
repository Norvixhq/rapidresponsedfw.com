]

FAQS = [
    ("How fast can you get to my property?",
     "<p>Our line is answered 24 hours a day and crews are dispatched from inside the Metroplex, so response is measured in the time it takes to drive to you rather than the time it takes to reach a call center. When you call, we will give you a realistic arrival window for your specific address and traffic conditions &mdash; and we will tell you exactly what to do in the meantime.</p>"),
    ("Do you work directly with insurance companies?",
     "<p>Yes. We document every job the way carriers and adjusters expect: dated photographs, moisture maps, daily drying logs, equipment counts and line-item scopes. We can speak with your adjuster directly, meet them on site, and in many cases bill the carrier so you are only responsible for your deductible. We are not a public adjuster and we do not negotiate your claim for you, but we make sure the physical evidence of the loss is captured properly.</p>"),
    ("How much does water damage restoration cost?",
     "<p>It depends on how much water there was, what it touched, how long it sat and whether it was clean, gray or black water. A small contained laundry-room leak is a very different job from a second-floor supply line that ran overnight through three rooms and a ceiling. Estimates are free, and we walk you through the scope before any work begins. If the loss is covered, your out-of-pocket cost is usually your deductible.</p>"),
    ("Can mold grow after a flood or leak?",
     "<p>Yes, and quickly. The EPA notes that mold can begin growing on damp materials within 24 to 48 hours. That is why speed matters more than almost anything else in water damage work: fast, complete drying is the most effective mold prevention there is. If materials stayed wet longer than that, we treat mold as a likely condition rather than a possibility and inspect accordingly.</p>"),
    ("What should I do before your crew arrives?",
     "<p>Safety first. If water is near outlets, panels or fixtures, shut off electricity to the affected area only if you can do so safely &mdash; otherwise wait for us. Shut off the water supply at the source or the main. Do not walk through standing water in a room with live power, and do not enter a fire-damaged structure until it has been cleared. If it is safe, move small valuables and electronics to a dry area, lift curtains and skirting off wet floors, and start photographing everything for your claim.</p>"),
    ("Do you provide free estimates?",
     "<p>Yes. Assessment and estimates are free, with no obligation. For an active emergency we will stabilize the situation first &mdash; stopping intrusion and extracting water &mdash; and walk the full scope with you once the property is out of danger.</p>"),
    ("Do you actually answer the phone at 3am?",
     "<p>Yes. Emergency restoration is not a business-hours trade. Supply lines fail at night, water heaters go on weekends and storms do not check the calendar. The number on this page reaches us around the clock, every day of the year.</p>"),
    ("How long does structural drying take?",
     "<p>Most residential water losses dry in three to five days, though it varies with the volume of water, the materials affected and the humidity outside. Hardwood, plaster and dense assemblies take longer than carpet and drywall. We set equipment to a calculated load and take moisture readings daily &mdash; the job is done when the readings say so, not when the calendar does.</p>"),
    ("Do you repair and rebuild, or only dry things out?",
     "<p>We do both. Many restoration companies stop at mitigation and hand you a list of contractors. We carry the job through demolition, drywall, flooring, cabinetry, trim and paint, which means one point of contact, one scope and no gap between the company that tore it out and the company that puts it back.</p>"),
    ("What areas do you serve?",
     "<p>We cover 29 cities across Dallas-Fort Worth, including Dallas, Fort Worth, Irving, Plano, Frisco, McKinney, Arlington, Garland, Denton, Grapevine, Southlake and the surrounding communities. If your address is in the Metroplex, call and we will confirm coverage immediately.</p>"),
    ("Is the water in my home dangerous?",
     "<p>It depends on the source. Category 1 is clean water from a supply line. Category 2 (gray water) comes from appliances, washing machines or toilet overflow without solids, and carries contaminants. Category 3 (black water) includes sewage, rising floodwater and any water that has sat long enough to grow bacteria &mdash; it requires containment, PPE and disposal of porous materials. We identify the category on arrival because it determines everything about how the job is handled.</p>"),
    ("Will my hardwood floors have to be replaced?",
     "<p>Not always. Hardwood that has cupped can often be dried in place with specialty floor drying mats and controlled dehumidification, then sanded and refinished after it stabilizes. Success depends on how long the water sat, what the subfloor is doing and whether the finish trapped moisture underneath. We will tell you honestly which way it is likely to go rather than defaulting to a tear-out.</p>"),
    ("Do you handle sewage backups?",
     "<p>Yes. Sewage is category 3 contamination and is handled with containment, full PPE, antimicrobial treatment and controlled disposal of affected porous materials. This is not a job for household cleaners or a wet vac &mdash; the health risk comes from bacteria and aerosolized contaminants, not just the visible mess.</p>"),
    ("Can I stay in my home during restoration?",
     "<p>Often yes, particularly if the loss is contained to one area. It depends on whether the affected area includes a kitchen or the only bathroom, whether there is mold or sewage involved, whether power to part of the home is off, and how much equipment noise you can live with. We will give you a straight answer at the assessment so you can make arrangements early rather than at 9pm.</p>"),
    ("What is that equipment noise, and does it have to run all night?",
     "<p>Air movers and dehumidifiers have to run continuously to hold the drying conditions we set. Turning them off overnight extends the job, and in a bad case it lets microbial growth start. It is loud and it is genuinely inconvenient, but it is the difference between a five-day dry-out and a tear-out.</p>"),
    ("Do you do fire damage as well as water?",
     "<p>Yes, and the two usually arrive together &mdash; the fire department leaves a lot of water behind. We handle emergency board-up and roof tarping, soot and char removal, smoke odor neutralization, contents cleaning and the full rebuild.</p>"),
    ("How do you get smoke smell out permanently?",
     "<p>Smoke odor is caused by microscopic residue that settles into porous surfaces and HVAC systems, so masking it never works. Real odor removal means physically cleaning affected surfaces, removing materials that cannot be cleaned, sealing what remains where appropriate, cleaning the duct system, and finishing with hydroxyl or ozone treatment depending on the situation.</p>"),
    ("Do you offer commercial restoration?",
     "<p>Yes. Retail, office, restaurant, warehouse and multi-family properties, including after-hours and phased work so you can keep operating. Commercial losses carry a business-interruption clock as well as a damage clock, and we scope them accordingly.</p>"),
    ("What is emergency board-up and when do I need it?",
     "<p>Board-up secures a property after fire, storm, vehicle impact or break-in: covering broken windows and doors, tarping compromised roofing and closing structural openings. It matters for two reasons &mdash; it prevents further weather and intrusion damage, and most policies require you to take reasonable steps to protect the property from further loss.</p>"),
    ("Do you remove and dispose of ruined furniture and debris?",
     "<p>Yes. Junk removal and debris haul-off is one of our core services and it is often part of a restoration job. Ruined furniture, soaked carpet and pad, demolition debris and contents that cannot be salvaged are documented for your claim first, then loaded and hauled away.</p>"),
    ("Can you store my belongings while the work is done?",
     "<p>Yes. We handle pack-out with a written inventory, transport, secure storage and move-back once the property is ready. It is the practical answer when the affected area is too large to work around or when contents need cleaning off site.</p>"),
    ("What certifications should a restoration company have?",
     "<p>The industry standard is IICRC certification &mdash; specifically WRT (Water Damage Restoration Technician), ASD (Applied Structural Drying) and AMRT (Applied Microbial Remediation Technician) &mdash; along with state licensing where required and current liability and workers' compensation coverage. Ask any company you are considering for proof of all of it, including ours, before work starts.</p>"),
    ("Will you tear out my drywall automatically?",
     "<p>No. Drywall is removed when it is saturated, when it is holding moisture against insulation that cannot dry, when it is contaminated by category 2 or 3 water, or when there is growth behind it. Otherwise we dry it in place. A company that opens every wall by default is either not measuring or is scoping for the invoice.</p>"),
    ("What happens if you find mold once you start?",
     "<p>We stop, contain the area so spores are not spread through the rest of the property, and tell you what we found before we proceed. Depending on the size of the affected area and your carrier's requirements, an independent hygienist may need to test and write a protocol. We will explain what applies to your situation rather than quietly expanding the job.</p>"),
    ("How do I know the property is actually dry?",
     "<p>By measurement, not by feel. We establish dry standard readings from an unaffected area of the same material, then take daily readings from affected materials until they match. Those readings go in your documentation package. If a company cannot show you numbers, they do not know whether the structure is dry either.</p>"),

      <h2>What actually causes property damage in DFW</h2>
      <p>Restoration is a seasonal trade. After enough years working the same metro area, the calendar becomes fairly predictable &mdash; and most of it is preventable if you know what to watch.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid grid-2"><div class="cause"><span class="cause-ico">{ico('drop')}</span><h3>Winter — hard freezes</h3><p>Attic and exterior-wall supply lines are the most common failure in DFW, because so much local plumbing runs through unconditioned space. A pipe freezes, a plug of ice pressurises the line, and it splits — often bursting the following morning as it thaws. Hose bibs, pool equipment and vacant properties with the heat turned off are the usual casualties.</p></div><div class="cause"><span class="cause-ico">{ico('wind')}</span><h3>Spring — hail and wind</h3><p>The Metroplex sits in an active hail corridor from roughly March through May. Roof bruising is frequently invisible from the ground; the reliable tell is dented soft metal — gutters, vents, air-conditioner fins. Wind breaks the seal between shingle courses, and the leak arrives weeks later.</p></div><div class="cause"><span class="cause-ico">{ico('fire')}</span><h3>Summer — heat and HVAC</h3><p>Attic temperatures above 140°F are hard on everything up there. Condensate lines clog and overflow through ceilings, drain pans rust through, and water heaters in attic closets fail into the rooms below. Second-storey laundry and supply lines add to it.</p></div><div class="cause"><span class="cause-ico">{ico('mold')}</span><h3>Year-round — aging systems</h3><p>Cast iron drains in homes built before about 1980, polybutylene supply lines from the late 70s to mid 90s, and galvanised steel in pre-1960 properties all fail on their own schedule. So do washing machine hoses, dishwasher supply lines, refrigerator ice-maker lines and toilet supply valves.</p></div></div>
    <p class="cost-note">{ico('shield')}<span><strong>The single most effective thing you can do</strong> is know where your main water shutoff is and confirm it actually turns, before you need it at 2am. After that, an automatic shutoff valve that closes on abnormal flow costs a fraction of one water loss.</span></p>
